I was fortunate to be asked by the CEO of [Axiado](https://axiado.com/), [Gopi Sirineni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopisirineni/) to co-author a paper called [Redefining Firmware Security](https://www.embedded.com/redefining-firmware-security/). The paper details existing ways companies leverage CPU vendors for forming a hardware root of trust (HRoT) and the improvement made by using Axiado silicon to authenticate board components.

Enjoy!
