When discussing blockchain security with peers, the conversation generally revolves around potential attacks and attack vectors. It's the concern of every CISO I know and one that can be difficult to break down without a solid foundation of understanding blockchain's core concepts. Before discussing how to threat model blockchain, we'll go over some foundational knowledge assumptions:

* [Blockchain architecture](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3191077/what-is-blockchain-the-complete-guide.html)
* [Cryptography, as it relates to blockchain](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/cryptography-in-blockchain)
* [Addressing](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-address-101/)
* [Nodes](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-what-is-a-node-or-masternode-and-what-does-it-do-4d9a4200938f)
* [Consensus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/consensus-algorithms-in-blockchain)
* [Networks](https://iltanet.org/blogs/deborah-dobson/2018/02/13/the-4-types-of-blockchain-networks-explained?ssopc=1)
* [Distributed Ledger Technology](https://www.r3.com/blockchain-101/)
* [Smart Contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/)

With the foundational knowledge above we can dissect potential threats to your blockchain as well as countermeasures.
