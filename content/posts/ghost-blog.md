New look, same scrutiny.
--------------

I figured it was time to move away from WordPress onto a faster platform, so I decided to give [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) a try. It is coded in [Node.js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) and uses [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as it's formatting syntax. Editing is facilitated using a split screen display, so it's hard to fudge things up.

A big shoutout to [Lars](http://lnoldan.com/) for hosting the previous blog for nearly a year.

Until next time...
