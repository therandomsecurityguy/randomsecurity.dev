I was again honored to be on a panel of distinguished leaders in the silicon security field at the [GSA 2022 Silicon Leadership Summit](https://community.gsaglobal.org/s/lt-event?id=a1U1K000006M21iUAC#/Overview). We discussed the benefits of the changing security industry from closed proprietary models to open collaborative innovation, how AI/ML models collaborate across end-to-end systems, and open source integration and continuous security testing practices across the industry.
