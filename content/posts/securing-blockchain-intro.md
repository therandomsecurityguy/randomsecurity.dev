I was recently pinged on a [LinkedIn thread](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6756641075332452352) regarding best practices for blockchain security. It made me realize that while there are many different locations that speak to different components of blockchain security, there wasn't a centralized repo of data that covered it all. By all, I mean more than just the fundamentals.

So, I'll be releasing a series of blog posts in the coming weeks addressing the following:

Threat models and attack vectors on the following:

- Cryptography and proofs
- Transaction security
- Identity management
- Smart contract security
- Chaincode security
- Blockchain exploits
- Previous research into next generation blockchain security techniques

Buckle in and enjoy!
